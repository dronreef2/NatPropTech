🚀 Getting Started
Using MCP Servers in this Repository
TypeScript-based servers in this repository can be used directly with npx.

For example, this will start the Memory server:

npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory
Python-based servers in this repository can be used directly with uvx or pip. uvx is recommended for ease of use and setup.

For example, this will start the Git server:

# With uvx
uvx mcp-server-git

# With pip
pip install mcp-server-git
python -m mcp_server_git
Follow these instructions to install uv / uvx and these to install pip.

Using an MCP Client
However, running a server on its own isn't very useful, and should instead be configured into an MCP client. For example, here's the Claude Desktop configuration to use the above server:

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]
    }
  }
}
Additional examples of using the Claude Desktop as an MCP client might look like:

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/allowed/files"]
    },
    "git": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-git", "--repository", "path/to/git/repo"]
    },
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<YOUR_TOKEN>"
      }
    },
    "postgres": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres", "postgresql://localhost/mydb"]
    }
  }
}
